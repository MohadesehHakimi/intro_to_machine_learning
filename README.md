# Machine Learning Specialization (Coursera)

This repository contains my notes, assignments, and code implementations from the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng.

The specialization covers the foundations and practical aspects of machine learning, including:
- Supervised learning (regression, classification, decision trees, random forests, XGBoost)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, anomaly detection, recommender systems)
- Best practices for machine learning development
- Deep learning basics and neural networks
